# Python projects

This is a series of projects found on this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TyqD2_oDtiQIh_Y55J5RfeA91JJECc97xYIKM112H9I/edit) or through "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart in order to practice my python scripting.

**Here are the porjects in this repository so far:**

bottles.py - 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall Lyrics  
-Learning ifs and print

magic ball.py - Magic 8 Ball. Type in a question, it will give an answer  
-Answers are in a list that are easy to add to  
-Will add a GUI once I learn about those modules
  
collatz.py - Input a number and it uses the Collatz Conjecture until the number reaches 1  
-Practicing for loops, defining functions, and handling errors

(not yet on github) Pythagorean Triples Checker - Type in 3 sides of a triangle and it will return if it is a right triangle or not.  
-Practicing using different input values

coin estimator.py - Coin Estimator By Weight - based on the weight of your coin collection, how many wrappers do you need and the total value  
-This is very much a work in progress. It started as a ton of dictionaries before trying to convert them into a cleaner pandas dataframe. Then I learned that I'm not as familiar with dataframes as I though.
